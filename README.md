# Bridge-ui

This repo hosts a simple interface to send tokens using the [Rialto bridge](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridges-common) between an Ethereum network and a Substrate network (one way).
Metamask (connected to Rialto network) is required to sign Ethereum transactions. The interface automatically connects to Rialto's Substrate nodes (no configuration or plugin required).

The interface is available at: [https://paritytech.github.io/bridge-ui](https://paritytech.github.io/bridge-ui)
