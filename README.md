# Bridge-ui

This repo hosts a simple interface to send tokens using the [Rialto bridge](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridges-common) between an Ethereum network and a Substrate network (one way).
Metamask is required to sign Ethereum transactions.

The interface is available at: [https://paritytech.github.io/bridge-ui](https://paritytech.github.io/bridge-ui)
